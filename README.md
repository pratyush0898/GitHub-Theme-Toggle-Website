# GitHub Theme Toggler Website

This is a simple website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates a theme toggler functionality for a GitHub-themed website. Users can switch between light, dark, and solarized themes using a dropdown menu.

## Features

* Three themes: light, dark, and solarized
* Theme persistence using localStorage (saves theme preference across browser sessions)
* Dynamic theme switching using JavaScript
* Interactive dropdown menu for theme selection
* GitHub logo animation on hover

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratyush0898/github-theme-toggler.git
   ```

3. Open the project in your code editor.

4. Open `index.html` in your browser directly.

## Usage

Navigate to the website in your browser. You should see the website with the default theme (light in this example). Click on the "Theme" dropdown menu in the navbar and select the desired theme: "light", "dark", or "solarize". The website will change its appearance accordingly.

## Customization

You can customize the website's appearance by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file.
