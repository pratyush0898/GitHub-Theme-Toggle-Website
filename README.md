# GitHub Theme Toggler Website

This is a simple website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates a theme toggler functionality for a GitHub-themed website. Users can switch between light, dark, and solarized themes using a dropdown menu.

## Features

* Three themes: light, dark, and solarized
* Theme persistence using localStorage (saves theme preference across browser sessions)
* Dynamic theme switching using JavaScript
* Interactive dropdown menu for theme selection
* GitHub logo animation on hover

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-theme-toggler.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):

   (No dependencies are listed in this example)

3. Open the project in your code editor.

4. Run the website:

   ```bash
   npm start  // Assuming you're using a frontend build tool like npm or yarn
   ```

   (If you're not using a build tool, you can open `index.html` in your browser directly.)

## Usage
